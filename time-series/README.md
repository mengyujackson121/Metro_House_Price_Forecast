## Washington DC - Virginia Metro Area: House Price Forecast

by Mengyu Jackson


## Business Problem
Mortgage lenders would like to predict mean house prices to minimize risk and increase profit. They also need to know how certain the predictions are. The goal is to predict house prices as far into the future as possible.


## Data 
Monthly average house prices from 1996 to 2018. After some statistical analysis, I realized there were fundamental differences between house price trends from 1996-2006 and 2008-2018. We did not include any data except the price for this model.


## Final Result
The model is not great past 3 month forecasts. To get a better result, a different process (not ARIMA-based) or additional data is required. ARIMA has been fully tried on the current data. Potential data for improving future models: monthly unemployment rates, interest rates, stock index prices, house prices in nearby areas, etc.
